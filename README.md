# Bubbles-UI Visualization

This repo replicates the effect of champagne bubbles floating upwards with clickable text inside. When a bubble is clicked, it zooms in to display the text more prominently. The bubbles continue floating once clicked away from [work in progress currently]

## Features

- **Floating Bubbles**: Bubbles of random sizes float upwards on the screen.
- **Dynamic Design**: The background features an ombre gradient inspired by the DoSomething.org website.
- **Interactive [SOON]**: Clicking on a bubble zooms in to reveal the text inside, and clicking away resumes the bubble's floating motion.
